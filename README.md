# What is Stable Asset?

**Stable Asset** is an asset synthesis protocol which generates synthetic asset which is backed by a basket of assets. Both the stable asset and the basket of underlying assets are with the same value peg.

For example, USDT, USDC and DAI are all USD-pegged. The stable asset generated by a basket of USDT, USDC and DAI is also USD-pegged. Indeed, it is much strongly pegged to USD than any of the individual stable coins so that any price shift of the underlying asset won't affect the value of synthetic USD asset.
